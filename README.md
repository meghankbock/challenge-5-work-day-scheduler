# challenge-5-work-day-scheduler

## Summary
This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and Javascript code for the Work Day Scheduler application. This application serves as a tool for tracking daily events/activities across 1-hour time blocks between 8AM and 5PM. Past time blocks are highlighted in gray, the current time block is highlighted in red, and future time blocks are highlighted in green (note: this information is updated every 5 minutes). Event descriptions can be inputed for each time block and then saved. The application also allows for data persistance by saving these events to local storage. Additional UI features include 1) highlighting unsaved input areas red and removing this highliting once saved and 2) notifying the user if the have tried to save a blank event description.
